The blocking techniques were originally introduced in:

George Papadakis, Ekaterini Ioannou, Themis Palpanas, Claudia Nieder√©e, Wolfgang Nejdl:
A Blocking Framework for Entity Resolution in Highly Heterogeneous Information Spaces. IEEE Trans. Knowl. Data Eng. 25(12): 2665-2682 (2013)

The code is written in Java version 7, using Apache Hadoop, version 1.2.0. All experiments were performed on a cluster with 15 Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS servers, one master and 14 slaves, each having 8 AMD 2.1 GHz CPUs and 8 GB of RAM. Each node can run 4 map or reduce tasks simultaneously, assigning 1024 MB to each task. The available disk space amounted to 4 TB and was equally partitioned among the 15 nodes. The cluster was provided by GRNET's ~okeanos service (https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/).
